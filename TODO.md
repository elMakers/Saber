# TODO

 - Use layers so saber only slices world (not drone or UI)
 - Maybe don't need to disable slicing behavior on menu if above
 - Improve icon model
 - Projector for lighted blade
 
## Drone 
 - Random movements
 - Firing laser blasts
 - Cylinder collider on blade, try changing movement to use SetPosition and SetRotation again
 - Reflect laser blasts
 - Streak count
 - Detect getting hit by saber (game over?)
 - Detect getting hit by reflected laser (game over + bonus?)
